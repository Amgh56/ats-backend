# Applicant Tracking System (ATS) – Mini Assessment

A simplified backend ATS built using NestJS, MongoDB, JWT, Mongoose, DTO validation, file uploads, and Swagger API documentation.

This API allows business users to create job posts and manage applicants, while talents can apply to jobs with their resume (PDF) and image (PNG).
